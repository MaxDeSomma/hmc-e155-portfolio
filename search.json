The most important devices we added to the protoboard were the UPduino v3.1 FPGA and Nucleo-L432KC MCU which we attached through header pins making them detachable. We also added switches, voltage regulators, and jumpers to set power for the MCU and FPGA. The hardest part was soldering all the SMT leds, capacitors, and resistors as it was tricky to get them in the correct place with how miniscule they were.\n\n\n\nCompleted Development Board"

    "text": "FPGA Design\n\nLab Description\nAfter I had thoroughly tested that my FPGA, MCU, and proto board worked, I designed some FPGA modules to control some LEDs. The task was to light up three LED’s and a seven segment display depedning on what dip switches were selected, described more in the table below.\n\n\n\nSignal Name\nSignal Type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ns[3:0]\ninput\nthe four DIP switches (on the board, SW6)\n\n\nled[2:0]\noutput\n3 LEDs (you may use the on-board LEDs)\n\n\nseg[6:0]\noutput\nthe segments of a common-anode 7-segment display\n\n\n\nTwo of the LEDs, led[0] and led[1], are designed accordingly:\n\n\n\n\ns1\ns0\nled[0]\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n0\n1\n1\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns3\ns2\nled[1]\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\nAnd led[2] blinks at 2.4 Hz.\nAs for the seven segment display it needs to read in the dip switch signals and display the four digit binary number as a single hexadecimal digit on the seven segment display. For example if the dip switch input s is 0110 the seven segment display must show a 6 while if its 1101 it must display a d.\n\nDesign\nBelow is my rough block diagram to control both the LEDs and seven segment display:\n\n\nLED Design\nTo design led[0] and led[1] we can clearly see that led[0] is simply an exclusive or (XOR gate) with input s0 and s1. While for led[1] you can use an and gate with s2 and s3. For the led[2] we had to make sure it blinked at 2.4 Hz. This means that every cycle will last around 0.4167 seconds. I decided I wanted a duty cycle of 50% meaning it needs to switch on or off every 0.2083 seconds. To design that I used the HSOSC library to utilize a clock that oscillates at 48 Mhz meaning it ticks every 2.083*10^-8 seconds. I then found that I would need 10^8 ticks to complete a half cycle for my LED. This allowed me to use a flip flop that counts every tick and switched the led on or off every 10,000,000 counts.\n\n\nSeven Segment Design\nTo design the seven segment display I used a submodule which had an input of s[3:0] and an output of seg[6:0]. This module then had a case statement with 16 cases, one for each off the possible dip switch combinations (4’b000, 4’b0001, … , 4’b1111). Once the verilog checked the case it would then turn off the specific pins that correlated to the specific segments to create each hexadecimal number. One interesting point about the seven segment display is that it was common annode, meaning it had one common pin at 3.3V and then you drive the other pin to low to light up the particular segment.\n\n\n\nTesting\nTo test my verilog was working according to my design I created and ran a test bench on my system verilog code. The testbench ran all 16 cominations of the dip switches and tested the expected led[3:0] and seg[6:0] vs what the actual outcome was in simulation.\n// sevenSeg_testvectors.tv\n// Max De Somma\n// mdesomma@g.hmc.edu\n// 9/3/24\n\n// [3:0]s, [2:0]led, [6:0]segment\n0000_000_1000000\n0001_001_1110011\n0010_001_0100100\n0011_000_0100001\n0100_000_0010011\n0101_001_0001001\n0110_001_0001000\n0111_000_1100011\n1000_000_0000000\n1001_001_0000001\n1010_001_0000010\n1011_000_0011000\n1100_010_1001100\n1101_011_0110000\n1110_011_0001100\n1111_010_0001110\nThe test vector file above was the one used in the test bench that had the correct output for every case. Every test passed proving the system verilog code worked correctly.\n\nHowever I was not able to test led[2] as you might have noted in the test vector file. This was due to the fact that the HSOSC libary was not include in model sim. However I was able to validate it using an oscilloscope proving it oscillates between 0 V and 3.3V at a freq of 2.42 Hz which is clsoe to the desired 2.40 Hz. \n\n\nWiring and Outcome\nAfter writing and testing my system verilog. It was time to connect the LED’s and Seven Segment to my FPGA using the following wiring schematic.\n\nHowever to prevent the seven segment drawing too much current I added current limiting resistors targeting 15 mA. Looking at the seven segment data sheet I found that the red led segments had a forward voltage of 1.8 V.\n\nAs you can see above this was used to calculate the resistance needed to set the current at 15 mA resulting in the use of seven 100 Ohm resistors for each segment.\nAfter finally wiring all the inputs and output to the FPGA and downloading the systemVerilog to the board we were able to succesfully"
