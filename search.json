    "text": "Lab Overview\nThe goal for this lab was to power two seven segment displays using seven output pins, by utilizing time multiplexing. In addition to using time multiplexing to run two seven segment displays, transistors were utilized to drive large currents to the common annodes of the seven segment displays. This allowed pins on the FPGA which aren’t capable of driving large currents themselves to use the transistors as a switch allowing the FPGA to toggle the displays on and off quickly."

    "section": "Design Approach",
    "text": "Design Approach\nTime multiplexing is a way to share expensive hardware for different purposes using specific timing. We used multiplexing in this lab by driving two seperate seven segment displays using only seven pins. How it works in this lab is that the same signal (i.e. the same hexadecimal number) is sent to both seven segments. However, two FPGA pins are used to control the common annode’s on either display, toggling one off while the other is on, and synchonously switching the hexadecimal output with the pwoer toggle at around 240 Hz to make it look as if there are two distinct numbers. Both displays are controlled by their own quad dip switch input, and lastly the sum of both numbers are displayed as a five bit number on five seperate LEDS.\n\n\n\nTwo working seven segment displays utilizing time multiplexing\n\n\nThe systemVerilog code that was flashed onto the fpga followed the block diagram below. The top module Lab 2 has inputs s1 [3:0] and s2 [3:0] which come from each of the quad dip switches. Those inputs then enter ledSum which is just an adder summing the two inputs into sum [4:0]. s1 and s2 also enter the sevenSegment module in addition to the clk signal which comes from the HSOSC. The sevenSegment module then alternates between turning on the left or right led segment using led1 and led2 outputs which are connected to the transistors as well as outputts the correct seg [6:0] output to light up specific segments on the display. led1 and led2 are toggled based on the 4.8 MHz clk signal which is modified to effectively act as a 240 Hz clock which flips led1 and led2 every cycle."

    "text": "Testing Approach\nTo test the modules discussed above a testbench was utilized to run a device under test. This test bench was quite simple compared to the last lab and did not utilize test vectors but instead was used to monitor when led1 and led2 toggled on or off and if the correct seg[6:0] was outputted depedning on which segment was powered. The DUT ended up being the segmentSwitcher module. Initially I planned to test each module seperately however the sevenSegment module was tested last week and ledSum just summed two inputs, so I decided to test all of segmentSwitcher. The systemVerilog used is provided below.\nmodule segmentSwitcher_tb();\n // Set up test signals\n logic clk;\n logic [3:0] s1,s2;\n logic led1, led2;\n logic [4:0] sum;\n logic [6:0] seg;\n\n // Instantiate the device under test\n segmentSwitcher dut(.s1(s1),.s2(s2), .clk(clk), .led1(led1),.led2(led2), .seg(seg), .sum(sum));\n\n // Generate clock signal with a period of 10 timesteps.\n always\n   begin\n     clk = 1; #5;\n     clk = 0; #5;\n   end\n\ninitial\n begin\n    // test different inputs\n    s1 = 4'b0000;\n    s2 = 4'b1111;\n    #20;\n    s1 = 4'b1000;\n    s2 = 4'b0001;\n    #20;\n    s1 = 4'b1010;\n    s2 = 4'b1001;\n    #20;\n end\nendmodule\nThe results from the wave function can be seen below. We can see that led1 and led2 oscillate oppositely as intended. In addition seg correctly outputs s1 if led1 is high and s2 if led2 is high. Lastly the summing module successfully sums s1 and s2 together and outputs it to sum."

    "text": "Wiring up the Board\nAfter writing the system verilog modules and thoroughly testing them in a testbench it was time to wire of the FPGA. The FPGA was wired according to the pin layout below. The transistors used were PNP transistors (PN 2907). These were used to drive the common annodes of the displays to 3.3V and were switched on when P47 and P2 were driven low.  Again resistors were used to limit the current for the I/O pins and the LEDs. The work for calculating the transistor base resistor, the seven segment resistor, and the yellow led resistor are shown below. The data sheet states that the recommended current for the FPGA I/O should be 8 mA. The transistor uses a diode that has a forward foltage of 0.7 V, from there we can calculate the resistance we need to set the current to 8 mA. The resistance ended up being 325 Ohms, which was close enough to the 330 Ohm resistors found in the lab. The seven segment display has a forward voltage of 1.8 V and the target amperage was 8 mA again, resuling in a resistance of 163 Ohms which was close to the 200 Ohm resistor in the cabinet. lastly for the yellow LEDs, I wanted them to be bright so I targeted a higher current of 15 mA, which correlates to a 100 Ohm resistance. Lastly for the addition quad dip switch used in this lab, internal FPGA pull up resistors of 100 kOhm were used."

    "text": "FPGA Design\n\nLab Description\nAfter I had thoroughly tested that my FPGA, MCU, and development board, I designed FPGA modules to control different LEDs. The task was to light up the LED’s and a seven segment display depending on what dip switches were selected, described more in the table below.\n\n\n\nSignal Name\nSignal Type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ns[3:0]\ninput\nthe four DIP switches (on the board, SW6)\n\n\nled[2:0]\noutput\n3 LEDs (you may use the on-board LEDs)\n\n\nseg[6:0]\noutput\nthe segments of a common-anode 7-segment display\n\n\n\nTwo of the LEDs, led[0] and led[1], were designed accordingly:\n\n\n\n\ns1\ns0\nled[0]\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n0\n1\n1\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns3\ns2\nled[1]\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\nled[2] did not follow a truth table but instead was designed to blink at 2.4 Hz.\nAs for the seven segment display it needs to read in the dip switch signals and display the four bit binary number as a single hexadecimal number on the seven segment display. For example if the dip switch input s[3:0] was 0110 the seven segment display must show a 6 while if it was 1101 it would display a d.\n\n\nDesign\nBelow is the block diagram used to design the combinational logic that that drove both the LEDs and seven segment display:\n\n\nLED Design\nTo design led[0] and led[1] we can clearly see that led[0] is simply an exclusive or (XOR gate) of input s0 and s1. While led[1] is an and gate of s2 and s3. For led[2] it was necessary to make sure it blinked at 2.4 Hz. This means that every cycle of led[2] will last around 0.4167 seconds. Using a duty cycle of 50%, the LED needs to switch on or off every 0.2083 seconds. The HSOSC library was utilized to create a clock that oscillated at 48 Mhz meaning it ticks every \\(2.083*10^-8\\) seconds. This meant that it would take \\(10^8\\) ticks to complete a half cycle for led[3]. To design this a flip flop was used that counts every tick and switched the led on or off every 10,000,000 counts.\n\n\nSeven Segment Design\nTo design the seven segment display the SystemVerilog module used a submodule which had an input of s[3:0] and an output of seg[6:0]. This submodule comntained a case statement with 16 cases, one for each off the possible dip switch combinations (4’b000, 4’b0001, … , 4’b1111). Once the SystemVerilog checked the case it would then turn off the specific pins that correlated to the specific segments to create each hexadecimal number. One interesting point about the seven segment display is that it was common annode, meaning it had one common pin at 3.3V, meaning the FPGA must drive the desired pin to low to light up the particular segment.\n\n\n\nTesting\nA test bench was used to test the SystemVerilog code was working according to the proposed design. The testbench ran all 16 cominations of the dip switches and tested the expected led[3:0] and expected seg[6:0] outputs vs what the actual output of the modules would be in simulation.\n// sevenSeg_testvectors.tv\n// Max De Somma\n// mdesomma@g.hmc.edu\n// 9/3/24\n\n// [3:0]s, [2:0]led, [6:0]segment\n0000_000_1000000\n0001_001_1110011\n0010_001_0100100\n0011_000_0100001\n0100_000_0010011\n0101_001_0001001\n0110_001_0001000\n0111_000_1100011\n1000_000_0000000\n1001_001_0000001\n1010_001_0000010\n1011_000_0011000\n1100_010_1001100\n1101_011_0110000\n1110_011_0001100\n1111_010_0001110\nThe test vector file above was the one used in the testbench that had the correct output for every case. Every test passed proving the SystemVerilog code worked correctly.\n\nHowever the testbench fell short as led[2] was not able to be tested which is clear in the photo above. This was due to the fact that the HSOSC libary was not include in model sim. However it was possible to validate it using an oscilloscope proving it oscillated between 0 V and 3.3V at a freq of 2.42 Hz which is close to the desired 2.40 Hz. \n\n\nWiring and Outcome\nAfter writing and testing the SystemVerilog, it was time to connect the LED’s and Seven Segment to my FPGA using the following wiring schematic.\n\nHowever to prevent the seven segment drawing too much current, current limiting resistors were added to all seven seg[7:0] pins targeting 15 mA. On the seven segment data sheet, it stated that the red led segments had a forward voltage of 1.8 V. This meant that voltage across the resistor would be 1.5 V, and thus could use V = IR with a target current of 0.15 mA to calculate R.\n\nAfter finally wiring all the inputs and the output to the FPGA and downloading the SystemVerilog module to the board the development board was succesfully able to drive the seven segment display and display the correct hexadecimal number and proper onboard LEDs. Additionally as shown above the led[2] blinked at the correct 2.4 Hz. This wraped up Lab 1, verifying that the development board worked properly while giving me a chance to design my own FPGA modules. In total this lab took 21 hours.\n\n\n\nThe correct output of led[0] and the Seven Segment displaying 6 for input 4’b0110\n\n\n\n\n\nThe correct output of led[1] and the Seven Segment displaying C for input 4’b110"

I think repition and completing the labs will definitetly help with this, and I hope to see how much I can grow on my E85 knowledge throughout this semester.\nOne other thing I have been thinking about during this lab is the differenc between using the FPGA and MCU. In E85 we used the FPGA the first half of the labs and the RISC-V based MCU the second half. I’m wondering what are the strength of the FPGA vs MCU and how to know when to use one instead of the other?"
