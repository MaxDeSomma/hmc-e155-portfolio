    "text": "This weeks lab was described as “a thinking persons lab” and it was nothing short of that. We had to design an FPGA to drive and read in inputs from a 16 button keypad, displaying the numbers on a dual seven segment display, easy right? This meant accounting for switch bouncing, shifting new hexadecimal numbers onto the dual display, and making sure that the external human input is synchronized with the system clock. Simulation turned out to be imperative for a design of this scale, however simulation can’t tell you everything. One constraint for this lab was that while one button is held the user should not be able to register another press of any button. However I kept running into a problem that was not caught in simulation. Anytime I pressed a button and then pressed a button in its respective column the seven segment would register the new keypress. Acknowledging this problem I frustratingly went through my code dozens of times and ran many more simulation to no success. While my past history using an oscilloscope had been dodgy I knew I woukld need to test the physical properties of the circuit. I realized that by pressing another column it was bouncing the SystemVerilog’s current state out into the scanning states, but I didn’t get why. I unenthusiastically hooked up the oscilloscope held one key and pressed the one right above, producing the following image.\n\n\n\nsrc: scaler.com\n\n\nTo my horror my held button signal would drop every time another key in the same column was pressed, driving it from 3.3 V to 0 V for split seconds. This was a huge moment in my lab as not only did I finally understand what bug was preventing me from finishing my design but I also understood why the oscilloscope is so useful. This phenomenon occured because when scanning the rows my modules forced the held button’s row high while the other row’s low meaning when another button in the same column was pushed down, the 3.3 V signal was fighting the 0 V signal coming into the same column pin forcing it to have the effect above. After visualizing that I was able to easily put in a work around to successfully debug my circuit! To simply conclude the oscilloscope is “a thinking persons tool.”"

    "text": "System-on-a-chip (SoC) is an integrated circuit that combines all the essential components of a computer on a singlular chip. SoCs have been popular in the mobile industry as you could combine the CPU, GPU, memory and other components on one chip leading to better power efficiency and space savings. This resulted in the boom of lighter, smaller, and longer lasting phones. Recently system on a chip design have begun to invade the computer market for the same benefits.\n\nApple had made a huge surge in SoC computers with their M1, M2, M3, and now M4 procesors. These chips were extremely succesful rocking the laptop market with extremely thin, light, and powerful laptops that boast better battery life as well. Window based computers have recently tried to jump on this train with ARM based SoC designs. While the computers have had impressive performance reviews a lot of windows apps have not been ported from the x86 architecture that AMD and Intel use to the newer ARM architecture. The lack of porting has led to new Windows devices not being fully capable of efficiently running some apps, leading to increased performance in some and slower speeds in other. I believe that this it is just a factor of time before SoC becomes dominant for mobile computer devices and I am interested to see what happens next."

    "text": "This week Professor Brake was out of town so the class taught themselves how to design PCB’s using KiCad. I had onyl ever used PCB’s but had never realized how they were designed or manufactured. This made me interested in learning about some of the history of PCB’s and where they came from.\nIn the early 1900’s PCB had not yet been invested and were built by manually winding copper around metal conductors. This meant building a circuit was a labor intesive, error full, and unreliable ordeal. In 1925 Charles Ducas created a patent of the earliest precursor to a PCB. He had created a way of making electrical paths on an insulated surface using conductice ink, literally “printed.”\n s Then in 36’ Paul Eisler had a huge breakthroughs in the UK. He had developed a way to print electrical circutis on a non doncutive base using copper foil. This gained huge popularity giving him the honor of being credited with inventing the modern PCB. Additionally the idea was accelerated during World War II finding great use in radios and military equipment. After WWII people realized how efficient PCB’s were and began using them in consumer products. Products continued to imrpove in the 60’s as SMT or surface mount technology were invented.\n\n\n\nYou can see SMT on C9 vs the THT on C5\n\n\nThis allowed chip components to be mounted on the surface instead of in through holes saving a lot of space allowing for a more complicated chip in a small area. From the 80’s onwards PCB’s were used in almost all electronic devices. However PCB development has not stagnated now a days Computer-Aided Design has allowed anyone to be able to design and create their own custom PCB like we did in class. More surprising is how fast and cheap it is for anyone to be able to pickup this skill and get their own PCB in their hands in a few days. I hope to get to use mine in Lab 6."

These headers could then be used in main to shift bits and call other related functions.\n\n\nClock Control\nBelow is the clock tree of the entire MCU. The first step is sending the system clock signal to all peripherals as they are powered off on reset to save power.\n\nFor this lab I used the default MSI 4 MHz clock as the system clock and enabled the GPIO, TIM6, and TIM16. Additionally before entering timer 6 and timer 16 a prescaler was used to divide the system clock to a 1 MHz signal. Enabling the peripherals and scaling down the clock involved setting the correct registers of the RCC module (reset & clock control) which can be seen at the top of main.\n\n\nTimer 6 (delay)\nTimer 6 or TIM6 which is a basic clock, was used to create a accurate delay in milliseconds that would be used to hold notes for a certain amount of time. You can see how it recieves its internal clock from RCC.\n\n\n\nTIM6 Block Diagram\n\n\nA function called setUpTIM6 was used where timer 6’s inputed clock was scaled down by a factor of 10 leaving it around 100 kHz. It was then updated and its counter was enabled to start counting up at a rate of around 100 kHz.\nFor the delay delayTIM6(int ms) was used. In this function the timer’s auto reload bits were set. Auto reload is a feature that resets the timer’s counter back to zero and raises a status register count matches the ARR register. This allows us to contorl the delay as the auto reload register was set depending on the input ms. The program would then wait till the status register flag was raised before continuing on with any other code. Finally it reset the status register back to zero for the next delay.\n\n\nTimer 16 (PWM)\nTimer 16 or TIM16 is a general purpose timer that has more features than timer 6. It was used to create a PWM signal that was then routed to a GPIO pin. Similarly it recieves its internal clock from RCC.\n\nThe setUpPWM(int frequency, int dutyCycle) was used to enable the timer and have it output a signal at the correct frequency and duty cycle. For PWM the auto reload register and capture/compare register must be set. This is because the output is low when ARR (auto reload register) &lt; CCR1 (capture/compare register) and high when ARR &gt; CCR1. ARR was set based on the timers clock input as well as the function inputs frequency and CCR1 was set to a fraction of ARR depeding on what dutyCycle was inputed as.\nFrom there the auto preload reload, capture/compare, PWM mode, main output, and preload register are enabled in addition to setting the capture/compare channel as an output. Lastly everything was updated and then the counter was enabled for timer 16 to begin counting up.\nTo change the frequency or duty cycle changeFreq(int frequency, int dutyCycle) was used. This function then set ARR and CCR1 according to the specified frequency and duty cycle and updated timer 16.\n\n\nGPIO\nIn E85 we had used GPIO as standard output or input, either reading in low and high signals or outputting low and high signals. But now we want to connect it the output of our timer 16. To do this GPIO alternate function was used. Inside the STM 32 every pin has alternate functions which you can find in the data sheet like the example below.\n\nAs we can see, the output from TIM16_CH1 which is the PWM output in our case, can be routed to pin PA6 if its using alternate function 14. This involved setting the GPIO alternate function low register so that pin 6 was set to AF14.\n\n\nPiecing it Together\nOnce the two timers (delay and PWM) were created and the GPIO was initiated to output to its correct alternate function, the rest was simple. The main function of the c code iterated through an array of frequencies and delays. The code would then tell the MCU to change the frequency of the output PWM and delay it for the specific amount of time till it had to change to the next frequency."

    "text": "Calculations\nThe first calculation was to calibrate exactly what the MSI clock was running at. When the MSI (default at 4 MHz) was routed into TIM16 it was prescaled by four meaning it should’ve have been at a rate of 1 MHz. To evaluate the true frequency of the MSI the following calculations were used.\n\nI started with the ARR formula that calculated the specific auto reload register value for a desired pitch of 496 Hz. When this ARR was used the oscilloscope showed that the actual pitch was around 488 Hz. Using this data the real speed of the scaled MSI could be calculated at 985.533 KHz. While it looks quite far from the expected its only around 1.5% off and the MCU clocks can have error in this range. After using the correct clock speed you can see below we get a much closer pitch of 495 Hz (within 1%).\n\nThe maximum and minimum duration and pitch then had to be calculated to make sure it could accurately play musical pieces. The calculations below show what the range of pitch and delays are.\n\nFor the duration timer I scaled down the clock by 10 to get an input clock of 98.453 Hz which leaves us with a range of delays from 0.01 to 665 ms. In hindsight I did not need to scale down the clock this much as we don’t need a delay that small, however it fit within the bounds of the songs we were trying to play. For the frequency the clock wasn’t scaled down any further which left us with a range of 15 Hz to 984 kHz which goes below and above the range of human hearing making it perfect for an audio output."

However the MCU does not have enough current output to drive a speaker. Due to this constraint an audio amplifier was used in the circuit below.\n\nThe LM348 was powered by the 5V voltage regulator on our PCB allowing the output to reach a max of 5 V and have sufficient current. The amplifier did not use any negative feedback but instead just multiplied V+ by the amplifier’s gain of 20. This obviously railed out quickly as PA6 outputted 3.3 V. To control the output voltage and to not annoy others’s in the lab a 10 kOhm potentiometer was used to vary the input signal before it got amplified acting as a volume knob. For fun I also powered the audio amplifier with 12 V from a desktop powersupply and was able to greatly increase the volume. Students in the ECF claimed they could hear it accross the hall."

A lot of this frustration came from the PWM as my code had to enable a lot of specific bits in the correct order and it turned out I was forgetting one important bit. Additionally it was hard to debug this lab and know which register we might have been missing, as if 15/16 of the registers were correct but that last one was wrong there would be zero output.

We used multiplexing in this lab by driving two seperate seven segment displays using only seven pins. How it works in this lab is that the same signal (i.e., the same hexadecimal number) is sent to both seven segments. However, two FPGA pins are used to control the common annode’s on either display, toggling one off while the other is on, and synchonously switching the hexadecimal output with the pwoer toggle at around 240 Hz to make it look as if there are two distinct numbers. Both displays are controlled by their own quad dip switch input, and lastly the sum of both numbers are displayed as a five bit number on five seperate LEDS.\n\n\n\nTwo working seven segment displays using time multiplexing\n\n\nThe systemVerilog code that was flashed onto the fpga followed the block diagram below. The top module Lab 2 has inputs s1 [3:0] and s2 [3:0] which come from each of the quad dip switches. Those inputs then enter ledSum which is just an adder summing the two inputs into sum [4:0]. s1 and s2 also enter the sevenSegment module in addition to the clk signal which comes from the HSOSC. The sevenSegment module then alternates between turning on the left or right led segment using led1 and led2 outputs which are connected to the transistors as well as outputts the correct seg [6:0] output to light up specific segments on the display. led1 and led2 are toggled based on the 4.8 MHz clk signal which is modified to effectively act as a 240 Hz clock which flips led1 and led2 every cycle."

This test bench was quite simple compared to the last lab and did not use test vectors but instead was used to monitor when led1 and led2 toggled on or off and if the correct seg[6:0] was outputted depedning on which segment was powered. The DUT ended up being the segmentSwitcher module. Initially I planned to test each module seperately however the sevenSegment module was tested last week and ledSum just summed two inputs, so I decided to test all of segmentSwitcher. The systemVerilog used is provided below.\nmodule segmentSwitcher_tb();\n // Set up test signals\n logic clk;\n logic [3:0] s1,s2;\n logic led1, led2;\n logic [4:0] sum;\n logic [6:0] seg;\n\n // Instantiate the device under test\n segmentSwitcher dut(.s1(s1),.s2(s2), .clk(clk), .led1(led1),.led2(led2), .seg(seg), .sum(sum));\n\n // Generate clock signal with a period of 10 timesteps.\n always\n   begin\n     clk = 1; #5;\n     clk = 0; #5;\n   end\n\ninitial\n begin\n    // test different inputs\n    s1 = 4'b0000;\n    s2 = 4'b1111;\n    #20;\n    s1 = 4'b1000;\n    s2 = 4'b0001;\n    #20;\n    s1 = 4'b1010;\n    s2 = 4'b1001;\n    #20;\n end\nendmodule\nThe results from the wave function can be seen below. We can see that led1 and led2 oscillate oppositely as intended. In addition seg correctly outputs s1 if led1 is high and s2 if led2 is high. Lastly the summing module successfully sums s1 and s2 together and outputs it to sum."

The FPGA was wired according to the pin layout below. The transistors used were PNP transistors (PN 2907). These were used to drive the common annodes of the displays to 3.3V and were switched on when P47 and P2 were driven low.  Again resistors were used to limit the current for the I/O pins and the LEDs. The work for calculating the transistor base resistor, the seven segment resistor, and the yellow led resistor are shown below. The data sheet states that the recommended current for the FPGA I/O should be 8 mA. The transistor uses a diode that has a forward foltage of 0.7 V, from there we can calculate the resistance we need to set the current to 8 mA. The resistance ended up being 325 Ohms, which was close enough to the 330 Ohm resistors found in the lab. The seven segment display has a forward voltage of 1.8 V and the target amperage was 8 mA again, resuling in a resistance of 163 Ohms which was close to the 200 Ohm resistor in the cabinet. lastly for the yellow LEDs, I wanted them to be bright so I targeted a higher current of 15 mA, which correlates to a 100 Ohm resistance. Lastly for the addition quad dip switch used in this lab, internal FPGA pull up resistors of 100 kOhm were used."

    "text": "FPGA Design\n\nLab Description\nAfter I had thoroughly tested that my FPGA, MCU, and development board, I designed FPGA modules to control different LEDs. The task was to light up the LED’s and a seven segment display depending on what dip switches were selected, described more in the table below.\n\n\n\nSignal Name\nSignal Type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ns[3:0]\ninput\nthe four DIP switches (on the board, SW6)\n\n\nled[2:0]\noutput\n3 LEDs (you may use the on-board LEDs)\n\n\nseg[6:0]\noutput\nthe segments of a common-anode 7-segment display\n\n\n\nTwo of the LEDs, led[0] and led[1], were designed accordingly:\n\n\n\n\ns1\ns0\nled[0]\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n0\n1\n1\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns3\ns2\nled[1]\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\nled[2] did not follow a truth table but instead was designed to blink at 2.4 Hz.\nAs for the seven segment display it needs to read in the dip switch signals and display the four bit binary number as a single hexadecimal number on the seven segment display. For example if the dip switch input s[3:0] was 0110 the seven segment display must show a 6 while if it was 1101 it would display a d.\n\n\nDesign\nBelow is the block diagram used to design the combinational logic that that drove both the LEDs and seven segment display:\n\n\nLED Design\nTo design led[0] and led[1] we can clearly see that led[0] is simply an exclusive or (XOR gate) of input s0 and s1. While led[1] is an and gate of s2 and s3. For led[2] it was necessary to make sure it blinked at 2.4 Hz. This means that every cycle of led[2] will last around 0.4167 seconds. Using a duty cycle of 50%, the LED needs to switch on or off every 0.2083 seconds. The HSOSC library was utilized to create a clock that oscillated at 48 Mhz meaning it ticks every \\(2.083*10^-8\\) seconds. This meant that it would take \\(10^8\\) ticks to complete a half cycle for led[3]. To design this a flip flop was used that counts every tick and switched the led on or off every 10,000,000 counts.\n\n\nSeven Segment Design\nTo design the seven segment display the SystemVerilog module used a submodule which had an input of s[3:0] and an output of seg[6:0]. This submodule comntained a case statement with 16 cases, one for each off the possible dip switch combinations (4’b000, 4’b0001, … , 4’b1111). Once the SystemVerilog checked the case it would then turn off the specific pins that correlated to the specific segments to create each hexadecimal number. One interesting point about the seven segment display is that it was common annode, meaning it had one common pin at 3.3V, meaning the FPGA must drive the desired pin to low to light up the particular segment.\n\n\n\nTesting\nA test bench was used to test the SystemVerilog code was working according to the proposed design. The testbench ran all 16 cominations of the dip switches and tested the expected led[3:0] and expected seg[6:0] outputs vs what the actual output of the modules would be in simulation.\n// sevenSeg_testvectors.tv\n// Max De Somma\n// mdesomma@g.hmc.edu\n// 9/3/24\n\n// [3:0]s, [2:0]led, [6:0]segment\n0000_000_1000000\n0001_001_1110011\n0010_001_0100100\n0011_000_0100001\n0100_000_0010011\n0101_001_0001001\n0110_001_0001000\n0111_000_1100011\n1000_000_0000000\n1001_001_0000001\n1010_001_0000010\n1011_000_0011000\n1100_010_1001100\n1101_011_0110000\n1110_011_0001100\n1111_010_0001110\nThe test vector file above was the one used in the testbench that had the correct output for every case. Every test passed proving the SystemVerilog code worked correctly.\n\nHowever the testbench fell short as led[2] was not able to be tested which is clear in the photo above. This was due to the fact that the HSOSC libary was not include in model sim. However it was possible to validate it using an oscilloscope proving it oscillated between 0 V and 3.3V at a freq of 2.42 Hz which is close to the desired 2.40 Hz. \n\n\nWiring and Outcome\nAfter writing and testing the SystemVerilog, it was time to connect the LED’s and Seven Segment to my FPGA using the following wiring schematic.\n\nHowever to prevent the seven segment drawing too much current, current limiting resistors were added to all seven seg[7:0] pins targeting 15 mA. On the seven segment data sheet, it stated that the red led segments had a forward voltage of 1.8 V. This meant that voltage across the resistor would be 1.5 V, and thus could use V = IR with a target current of 0.15 mA to calculate R.\n\nAfter finally wiring all the inputs and the output to the FPGA and downloading the SystemVerilog module to the board the development board was succesfully able to drive the seven segment display and display the correct hexadecimal number and proper onboard LEDs. Additionally as shown above the led[2] blinked at the correct 2.4 Hz. This wraped up Lab 1, verifying that the development board worked properly while giving me a chance to design my own FPGA modules. In total this lab took 21 hours.\n\n\n\nThe correct output of led[0] and the Seven Segment displaying 6 for input 4’b0110\n\n\n\n\n\nThe correct output of led[1] and the Seven Segment displaying C for input 4’b110"

    "text": "Lab Overview\nThe goal of this lab was to use 16 button keypad to display the last two hexadecimal digitals pressed on the double seven segment display. This becomes more tricky than it sounds. This is because the FPGA must fight against switch bouncing and metastability. The keypad is just a series of rows and columns that are connected depending on which button is pressed. When pushed a connection is formed and there is a short between the specific row and column.\n\nSwitch bouncing displayed in the diagram below, is the phenomenon where signals from a switch can appear as if they are flipped on and off repeatedly in an extremely short time frame. This is due to the physical characteristic of buttons. When the two peices of metal come together to form a connection they make contact initially for a small amount of time and then seperate until connecting again, repeating this cycle until it is fully connected.\n\n\n\ncircuitdigest.com\n\n\nDepending on your button you might see zero switch bouncing or extreme switch bouncing ranging from a few micro seconds to milliseconds. After testing the lab keypad I found that they had zero switch bouncing on any button as you can see from the oscilloscope below. However the systemVerilog still acounted for the possibility.\n\n\n\nOscilloscope of pressing a switch\n\n\nThe other problem the keypad has is metastability. Metastability can happen with digital logic when physical inputs don’t line up with the clock cycles correctly and are incorrectly sampled before the signal is fully stable. To fix that synchronizers were used to make sure the signal was stable. This can be accomlished using multiple flip flops and only using the stable output.\n\n\n\nnandland.com"

    "text": "Design the FSM\nTo design this lab we had to implement an FSM to make sure that when a button held it is only registered as one valid press and you can’t press other buttons while its held. The following FSM was used.\n\nFor this lab I decided that the FGPA would output a signal to drive the rows high and the columns would be inputs to the FPGA to show when there is a vaild connection. However you can’t scan all four rows at the same time as then whenever a column recieved an input you wouldn’t be able to tell which button in the column it came from. To fix this the FSM scanned all the rows. Driving each one high seperately for one clock cycle each until the FPGA recieved a valid column signal. The FSM would then branch out holding that one row high to help determine which button is being pressed, and then it would enable the seven segment decoder to show a new number. Once the button is released it goes back to scanning.\nThe systemVerilog code followed the following block diagram.\n\nIn the top level module we defined the HSOSC and inputed that into the Master module. The master module then slowed down the clk and inverted the reset as the onboard switches use pull up resistors. The inputs c and reset then went into the synchronizer where we used two flip flops to make sure that c was stable as it entered the FSM. In the FSM en, counter, and rowPressed was generated which were used in the buttonDecoder and ledController. The FSM also determined which rows were powered by determining the logic for r. buttonDecoder took in c and rowPressed and then determined which four bit hexadecimal number it corresponded to outputting it as s. s,en, counter, clk, and reset was inputed into ledController which was built upon the last lab and was able to use time multiplexing to drive two seven segments displays outputting which seven segment should be based on led1 and led2 as well as the number seg. Additionally it used counter to create a digital low pass filter and make sure that if there was any switch bouncing it would not incorrectly affect the output."

    "text": "Testing all the Modules\nDue this labs complexity a lot more was tested in simulation before it was uploaded to the FPGA and wired up. The modules simulated were buttonFSM, ledController, and buttonDecoder. We first tested the buttonDecoder module. This involved making a simple testbench that gave it some example key presses to determine if it would output the correct 4-bit signal representing the hexadecimal pressed. From the wave below you can see that it outputs the correct signal based on the key pressed. You can also see that when two keys pressed together are simulated the ledDecoder goes to its default case statement of F however concerning the FSM should prevent two keys from being pressed simultaneously.\n\n\n\nledDecoder Test Bench\n\n\nThe next module tested was ledController. The idea behind ledController is similar to last lab where it drives a double seven segment display. However we also wanted it to shift the numbers over as a new one was pressed, shifting everything left and adding the new onw on the right if it had the proper enable from the FSM. From the wave output below it shows that s1 and s2 the two hexidecimal numbers for the two led displays only change when en is high and shift properly, with s1 getting s and s2 getting s1 in a flip flop. Additionally ledController switched which seven segment was on at the right speed and outputted the corresponding seven bit seg number to turn on certain diodes.\n\n\n\nledController Test Bench\n\n\nThe final module tested was the FSM. For the testbench of the FSM, it was simply initialized as the device under test and then reset. On the wave we can see that after it is reset it properly scans through all the rows powering them high. Then we can input a single column pretending as if there is a real time input. This results in a specific row staying high until the FSM move into the next state where all the rows are high so we don’t see any of the errors mentioned in my blog, until the button is released. However we have the rowPressed variable at the bottom that keep track of which row was pressed initially so that the ledDecoder works properly. It then returns to scanning again. Near the end of the wave an input of 1000 half a clock cycle later the input changes to 1100 simulating someone pressing another button. The module however does not change the colPressed and will output the correct hexadecimal number\n\n\n\nFSM Test Bench"

In the end the keypad was able to communicate user input to the FPGA shifting the dual seven segment display to the correct number on the right side. Additionally the synchronizers were used to get rid of metastable inputs, the FSM countered any switch bouncing from the keypad, and it properly dealt with multiple key presses at once.\nVideo\nTime in lab: 23 Hours."

    "section": "MCU Design",
    "text": "MCU Design\n\nSetup\nIn this lab we were allowed to use the CMSIS library meaning we no longer had to design structs for each register used in this lab. However we still need to need to make our own register specific functions which we can pull from our growing library we started last lab.\nIn this lab we needed to continually check if the two signals from the encoder were rising or falling. One way to do that would be to use polling. This would mean in our main loop we could have manually checked if the GPIO pin connected to the encoder output changed. However there is a large issue with polling which is that the all the logic in the while loop takes time to evaluate, meaning that when you check for GPIO you could miss the signal if the other part of your main loop are running. We need a way to immediately raise a flag if our the input changes. Luckily this is where interrupts come in. Interrupts are a way to tell the MCU to give immediate attention if a signal is changed. We can input our encoder signal and then whenever the signal has a risign or fallign edge the MCU will immediately run a service routine that executes some small but crucial code.\nThe first part of the MCU design was to enable the GPIO pins that will read in the quadrature encoder. In this lab PA6 and PA8 were used. I originally was going to use PA5 and PA6 however the encoder outputs 5 V signals and PA5 is only rated for 3.3 V. These pins were then enabled and set as input. Afterwards two timers were initiated. TIM2 was used as a delay timer that counted at a frequency of 1 kHz (period of 1ms) and TIM6 was used as timer to measure the time between the encoder signals. Given that it was measuring relatively quick signals I wanted to the frequency to be much faster so it was prescaled to 1 MHz (period of 1 us).\nThe interrupts were then enabled using RCC and setting the configuration and mask register so that PA6 and PA8 would trigger an interrupt. The interrupts were then set to trigger on both the falling and rising edge of the signal. Lastly the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller was configured to allow the CPU to respond to interrupt lines 9 through 5 thus including 6 and 8 which correspond to our pins.\nThe specific service routine under the function prototype void EXTI9_5_IRQHandler(void); could then be configured to whatever logic we wanted to apply in the interrupt.\n\n\nInterrupt Design\nOnce an the interrupt is triggered and service routine funciton is called the first thing to do is check which pending register was enabled as this tells the code if the signal came from PA6 or PA8. If both PA6 and PA8 are at the different values TIM6 is reset back to a count of zero and then when PA6 and PA8 are at the same value either high or low the current count of TIM6 is saved to a global variable called delta. The flow chart is included below.\n\n\n\nLoop Design\nThe most important function in the main loop is calculating the speed of the motor. The speed is calculated in terms of revolutions per second based on the time between edges we recieve in the interrupts. The main loop is also in charge of printing the speed using printf() and causing a delay of around 250 ms so that we don’t printf too rapidly. Lastly we check the time between edges and if there is too much seperation we assume the motor is off and set the speed to zero."

Therefore we can use \\(\\frac{r}{p}*\\frac{p}{s} = \\frac{r}{s}\\). To find \\(\\frac{p}{s}\\) the first thing we can do is take the quarter wave count and multiply it by \\(4\\) to get the full wave count. We then divide it by \\(1,000,000\\), which is our clock frequency, to get the period of a full pulse wave in seconds \\(\\frac{s}{p} = \\frac{4\\Delta}{1000000}\\). We then know \\(\\frac{r}{s} = \\frac{1000000}{4\\Delta} * \\frac{1}{120} =  \\frac{1000000}{480\\Delta}\\). We can use this equation in our main while loop to calulate the revolutions per second."

Looking at the diagram below, you can see how time division multiplexing generally works. The source transmits multiple packets or frames of input data using a mux and then based on an input signal to the demux it sorts them in the right outputs. This makes an efficient way to transmit and recieve independant signal over a commong single path. During my research it reminded me of morse code, where we have the operator on one side who has a message and then turns it into a series of long and short pulses (0’s and 1’s) and then send it to the opeartor on the other side through a single wire. The operator on the other side then acts as the demux configuring it back into a message.\n\n\n\nsrc: scaler.com\n\n\nIn this lab, we used this idea generally, allowing us to send a double wide signal through a single path and then decoding it based on the timing on the other side. One real life example that I had never thought about was telephone calls. They use the same process of time multiplexing to send multiple calls using one wire. I am sure I will begin to see this everwhere now!"
