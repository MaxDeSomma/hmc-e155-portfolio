Every year around the end of the fall semester Harvey Mudd takes part in a tradition called broom ball. Broom ball is a recreational sport that is somewhat similar to ice hockey but simpler and more accessible. Instead of ice skates and hockey sticks. You just wear regular shoes and get a broom on the ice. Then in a team of six you pass and shoot a dodgeball into the opponents net.

However Mudd takes a different approach on this, usually two entire dorms show up to the ice rink totalling over 100 people. Due to the amount of people chaos quickly ensues. A dodgeball is then tossed on the rink and everyone runs for it. Luckily brooms are not used, and it ends up being a mad dash for the ball with kids slipping, falling, and sliding, until someone gets is able to grab it with their hands and get close enough to a goal to shoot the ball. To make it even better, intead of just getting past one goalie you now have six people defending the goal resulting in some extreme tactics. While it is a mess and we get kicked out of the ice rink each year it is a fun tradition that I hope continues on.
