Every year the hoch puts on a special dinner just for thanksgiving apptly called Hochsgiving. It is a glorious day at Harvey Mudd college and it happened two days ago on Thursday. Each dorm gets dressed up together like a family and heads over to hoch. From there we line up outside as an entire school, literally every student at mudd goes to this one dinner. Slowly we file into the hoch dsitributing ourselves at different stations. Getting turkey, potatoes, pasta, bread, stuffing, and of course gravy. Each dorm then has their unique seating and sits down together eating food and talking. We all go around saying what we are thankful for. While it kind of cheesy. It is a nice distraction from your classes at Mudd and a way to spend time with the people at your dorm you don't always get to spend time with.
