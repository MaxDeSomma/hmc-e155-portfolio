This past week was fall break. Fall break is a short gap from school where we have Monday and Tuesday off from classes. This year for fall break I decided to visit my sister who lives in San Diego in order to try to learn how to surf. Like every other person who lives in San Diego my sister has begun to learn how to surf and would always brag about how good she was. Being a younger brother I naturally doubted her abilities and would tell myself I would be a better surfer than her with one day and had to prove it. 

My roommate and I drove down to San Diego Friday night and was expecting a warm beach town like everyone thinks it is.

However to our surprise it was overcast, cold, and foggy much like San Francisco.

We woke up early saturday morning at 7:30 am and walked a mile down the street barefeet each carying an 8 foot long foam surfboard. Arriving on the sand we couldn't even see the water with the amount of fog that had rolled in but we plunged ourselves into the Pacific ocean. Hands and feet immediately went numb but the wetsuit we had rented kept the rest of our body surpsingly toasty. Under my sisters guidence my roomate and I timidly paddled out. Already paddling was more difficult that I imagined and I used to swim for CMS. To make it worse we were genuinely horrible at timing the waves, getting smacked by each and every one. Finally we made it out and turned around for our first wave. To no surprise we did not catch it. When we did finally catch a wave all we could manage was white water and getting to our knees. It was much much harder than we imagined. Turning to look at my sister I assumed she was surely having as bad of a time as we were. Unfortunately what I saw was truly impressive. She was flawlessy catching much bigger waves and actually standing on her surfboard which is much more challenging to use that the giant foam ones we had. We continued to surf for another two hours until the fog eliminated all eyesight. To my dismay I did have to admit to my sister that she was better than me but I hope to try again and maybe I will be better than her on my second day.
