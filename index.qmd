Hello I am Max De Somma, a senior Engineering major at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, California. My academic interests include a mixture of electrical and mechanical design which I am hoping to deepen in E155. I currently work in the student machine shop on campus where I help students and 
faculty learn how to safely operate heavy machinery. When I am not doing homework or in the shop, I enjoy 
 riding bikes, swimming, and playing board games.
